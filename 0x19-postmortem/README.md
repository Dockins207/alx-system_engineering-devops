**Postmortem: Database Outage Leading to Partial Service Downtime**

**Issue Summary**

On March 5th, 2024, from 14:00 to 16:30 GMT, our web application experienced a partial outage affecting approximately 35% of our user base. During this period, users encountered significantly slower response times and intermittent timeouts when attempting to access our service. The root cause was identified as a misconfigured database update that led to excessive load on our primary database server.

**Timeline**

14:00 GMT - Issue detected through automated monitoring alerts indicating high latency and error rates.
14:05 GMT - Initial investigation by on-call engineer suspected a spike in traffic or a DDoS attack.
14:20 GMT - Traffic analysis showed normal patterns; attention shifted to backend services.
14:30 GMT - Database metrics reviewed, revealing unusually high load on the primary database server.
14:45 GMT - Misleading assumption that a hardware failure was causing the high load led to unnecessary checks of server health.
15:00 GMT - The incident escalated to the database engineering team upon realizing the issue persisted despite healthy hardware indicators.
15:20 GMT - Detailed log analysis by database engineers uncovered a recent misconfiguration in database indexes introduced during the last update.
15:45 GMT - Temporary measures to redirect traffic to secondary databases reduced the impact on users.
16:00 GMT - Misconfiguration corrected and normal database operations restored.
16:30 GMT - Monitoring confirmed system stability; incident closed.

**Root Cause and Resolution**

The root cause was traced back to a database update executed earlier that day, which included changes to several database indexes. These changes were intended to improve query performance. However, a misconfiguration resulted in certain queries running without proper indexing support, leading to full table scans and causing excessive load on the database. The issue was compounded by the database's inability to effectively cache and reuse query results, further degrading performance.
The resolution involved reverting the index changes to their previous state and applying a correct set of index modifications that had been rigorously tested in a staging environment. This immediately reduced the load on the database server, restoring normal operation. To prevent user impact during the resolution, traffic was temporarily redistributed to secondary database servers, which had been underutilized.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures**

To prevent similar issues in the future, several corrective measures have been identified:
*Review and Enhance Deployment Procedures*: Ensure that all changes to database schemas or configurations are reviewed by at least two database engineers and tested in a staging environment that accurately mirrors production.
*Improve Monitoring and Alerting*: Enhance monitoring of specific database performance metrics such as query execution times and index usage. This will ensure quicker detection and more accurate diagnosis of issues.
*Database Configuration Management*: Implement a database configuration management tool that tracks changes and facilitates quick rollbacks when issues are detected.
*Training and Documentation*: Provide additional training for all engineers on database management best practices and update internal documentation to include guidelines for making and deploying database changes.

**List of Tasks**
Implement a peer review process for all database schema and configuration changes.
Upgrade monitoring tools to include detailed metrics on database performance and alerting thresholds.
Deploy a database configuration management tool with rollback capabilities.
Schedule a quarterly database management best practices workshop for the engineering team.
Update internal documentation to reflect the new procedures and tools introduced.
This incident highlighted the critical importance of rigorous testing and
review procedures for database changes. By implementing the measures outlined
above, we aim to significantly reduce the risk of similar outages and ensure a
more reliable service for our users.
